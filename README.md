# Welcome to JAVA Chat App!
<br/>


## Getting Started

There are runnable .jar files named ClientServer.jar and ClientChatApp.jar. What we have to do is just double click those runnable files and they will run. Server requires a host name to host the server. The program will automatically detect the local ip address of the host machine and start the server. Otherwise, you can enter ip address manually.
In the client app you need to provide an username and host IP address and our program will automatically connect it. It uses a secure algorithm to secure chats and help it from being stolen. 
You can create multile clients and connect to the server. The app is completely portable from one device to another. It will run on any java supported machine.

<br/>

## Depencies:
	The app only needs java installed in the computer to run! thats all!
<br/>
<br/>

## Architecture
	Client - Server
<br/>
<br/>

## Security Functions

* This app is secured by encryption.
* It does not contain any harmful contains
* We do not store your data
* All chats are self-destructive. i.e After chat messages will be deleted
* There is a logout function to help logging out from the app
<br/>

## TroubleShooting

If you are unable to execute the java files then probably you have no executable permission for the jar file in your pc. In that case please grant permission.
To do so in linux type "chmod +x "file name"" in terminal.
